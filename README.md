Brief description of the app and its purpose.

This app lets the user query different endpoints of an API, allows for personalized subsets of the data to be downloaded, and many customizable visualizations.  

• A list of packages needed to run the app.

• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to running your app).

• The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
